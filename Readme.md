# SII manager for property bookings
This code if for the purpose of managing the SII needed documents (factura & boleta) when rentaling a property.
For now, a property rental can be done through Airbnb or Direct booking.
Everytime a property is rented, a new `boleta` for the rental is needed.

If:
   - When booking was through Airbnb: also is needed a `factura compra` for the service provided by Airbnb.
   - When direct booking needs a factura, then a `factura venta` is needed instead of a `boleta`. 
   - This flow does not support Airbnb with factura.
